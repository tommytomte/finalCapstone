These guidelines outline the proper methodology for creating a text file for an NLP project that categorizes various use cases of NLP applications. The use cases discussed include a model that sorts emails into appropriate folders, a model that assists in grading essay questions, and a model that aids doctors in diagnosing patients. These models have been specifically designed to provide practical and efficient solutions to everyday problems. With these guidelines, developers can create NLP applications that are both effective and reliable.
